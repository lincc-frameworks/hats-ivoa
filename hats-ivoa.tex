\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
The increasing complexity and volume of astronomical datasets necessitate efficient spatial indexing and query strategies within the Virtual Observatory (VO). 
The Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme (HATS) is a framework designed to facilitate scalable queries, filtering operations, and efficient data retrieval across large astronomical surveys. 
Traditional spatial indexing methods often struggle with the massive scale of modern astronomical datasets, leading to inefficient query execution and storage overhead. 
HATS provides a flexible, hierarchical approach that balances computational efficiency and adaptability to non-uniform data distributions.\par

This document describes the structure, implementation, and best practices for integrating HATS within the VO ecosystem, ensuring interoperability and performance optimization for distributed astronomical datasets. We point out how HATS enhances existing indexing schemes, discuss its role in federated data access, and show how it enables powerful applications for large-scale survey science and efficient cross-matching of astronomical catalogs. \par 
The reference implementation of HATS can be found at \url{https://github.com/astronomy-commons/hats}.

\section{Introduction}
The rapid expansion of astronomical data from large survey facilities like Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Euclid, and Roman Space Telescope necessitates innovative solutions for spatial indexing and efficient data retrieval. 
These surveys generate vast amounts of high-resolution imaging and time-domain data, requiring efficient methods for organizing, querying, and cross-matching data across multiple archives. 
Traditional approaches to spatial indexing, such as hierarchical pixelization (e.g., HEALPix  \citep{gorski:healpix}) or static tiling schemes, often exhibit inefficiencies when handling uneven sky densities.

The Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme (HATS) is a novel approach designed to optimize spatial data partitioning while maintaining flexibility in accommodating varying data densities. 
Unlike fixed spatial partitioning methods, HATS adaptively adjusts tile sizes based on local data characteristics, ensuring an optimal balance between resolution, query efficiency, and storage management. 
By leveraging a hierarchical structure, HATS enables efficient spatial queries, allowing users to quickly focus on regions with fine-grained detail when needed, while maintaining scalability across large areas.

This document aims to define best practices for implementing and utilizing this tiling scheme within the Virtual Observatory framework. 
This document outlines the principles behind HATS, describes its data model, and provides recommendations. 
Additionally, we discuss how HATS can facilitate efficient cross-matching of astronomical catalogs, accelerate large-scale spatial queries, and enhance interoperability between diverse astronomical datasets.

\section{Motivation and Goals}
The primary motivation behind HATS is to address the following challenges in astronomical data management:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} Modern astronomical surveys generate petabytes of spatially distributed data, requiring an indexing scheme that scales efficiently with dataset size.
    HATS provides such an indexing scheme, and creates files whose properties and size are well-suited to parallel operations.
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Spatial Resolution:} Fixed grid-based partitioning often leads to inefficient storage and query execution, particularly in non-uniformly distributed datasets. 
    HATS adaptively adjusts tile sizes to accommodate varying data densities.
    \item \textbf{Efficient Query Execution:} Spatial queries such as nearest-neighbor searches and cross-matching must be executed efficiently across distributed data repositories. 
    HATS enables rapid indexing and retrieval of relevant data subsets, and provides an balanced partitioning of data.
    \item \textbf{Interoperability:} Astronomical data is collected from diverse instruments and observatories, often using different spatial reference frames. 
    HATS provides a standardized framework for integrating and harmonizing spatial data across multiple repositories.
\end{itemize}

\section{HATS Design and Implementation}

\subsection{HATS Catalog Directory Structure} \label{sec:catalog}

The HATS framework relies on spatially sharding catalogs into Parquet files of approximately the same size. 
Here, we discuss how this is achieved and additional concepts that make it easier to use this main idea for astronomical research.

The central unit of data storage is the HATS \texttt{catalog}. 
It stores the data along with the associated metadata needed to access it. 
The  \texttt{catalog} organization structure is shown in Listing~\ref{fig:exampleCatalogStructure}.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example catalog directory contents, label=fig:exampleCatalogStructure]
catalog/
|-- [REQUIRED] properties
|-- [RECOMMENDED] partition_info.csv
|-- [OPTIONAL] point_map.fits
|-- [OPTIONAL] data_thumbnail.parquet
+-- dataset/
    |-- [RECOMMENDED] _metadata
    |-- [RECOMMENDED] _common_metadata
    |-- Norder=0/
    |-- Norder=1/
    |-- Norder=2/
    |-- Norder=3/
    |-- Norder=4/
    |-- Norder=5/
    |-- Norder=6/
    +-- Norder=. . ./
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

The astronomy data is stored in the directory \texttt{dataset}, and further, within the subdirectories that specify the order at which particular part of the dataset is stored. 
We will discuss the partitioning and data storage in Sections~\ref{sec:hierarchical}, \ref{sec:adaptive} and \ref{sec:parquet}. 
The other files visible above are various metadata and auxiliary files that are here to enable better and easier handling of the data and we will describe them in Section~\ref{sec:meta}. 
    
\subsubsection{Hierarchical Directory Structure} \label{sec:hierarchical}
Focusing now on the dataset's contents, HATS employs a multi-level hierarchy based on HEALPix tiling.
Each level corresponds to a single HEALPix order and represents a progressively finer spatial resolution.

All tiles of the same HEALPix order are contained within the same prefix \texttt{Norder=k} directory. 
To avoid directories becoming too large for some file systems, the tiles are then grouped by a \texttt{Dir} subdirectory prefix,
where the value of the \texttt{Dir} key is the result of integer division by 10,000 of the pixel number.

We see the directory structure in Listing~\ref{fig:datasetWithLeaf}, showing a dataset with leaf Parquet files at several HEALPix orders.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example catalog dataset directory contents, label=fig:datasetWithLeaf]
dataset/
|-- . . .
|-- Norder=6/
|   |-- Dir=0/
|   |   |-- Npix=0.parquet
|   |   |-- . . .
|   |   +-- Npix=9999.parquet
|   +-- Dir=10000/
|       +-- Npix=10000.parquet
|           +-- . . .
|-- Norder=7/
+-- . . .
\end{lstlisting} 
\end{minipage}

The data is stored in the Parquet files (discussed in Section \ref{sec:parquet}), with one or multiple files being possible in the final directory, i.e., in the ultimate data leaf.  \par 
If there are multiple files representing a single data partition, they should be read together, i.e., we consider them to be one single data unit. In this way, small updates can be added to already existing  \texttt{catalogs} with simple, correctly placed, additions of files in existing folders. \par 
With such functionality, it is possible to continuously update catalogs with small updates, e.g., nightly additions, without the need to rebuild the whole catalog. The price is the imbalance between the sizes of the data leaves, and the dataset needs to be rebuilt once this imbalance becomes too large from the standpoint of the catalog provider.


Such a directory structure would appear as shown in Listing~\ref{fig:datasetWithDir}.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example catalog dataset directory contents with leaf directories, label=fig:datasetWithDir]
dataset/
|-- . . .
|-- Norder=6/
|   |-- Dir=0/
|   |   |-- Npix=0/
|   |   |   |-- part0.parquet
|   |   |   +-- . . .
|   |   +-- Npix=9999/
|   |       |-- part0.parquet
|   |       +-- . . .
|   +-- Dir=10000/
|       +-- Npix=10000/
|           |-- part0.parquet
|           +-- . . .
|-- Norder=7/
+-- . . .
\end{lstlisting} 
\end{minipage} 

\subsubsection{Adaptive Tiling Algorithm} \label{sec:adaptive}
Unlike static partitioning schemes, HATS adaptively subdivides spatial regions based on data angular density. 
In areas with sparse data, larger HEALPix tiles minimize storage overhead, whereas high-density areas are subdivided into smaller tiles to improve query efficiency. \par

The data is stored at a given level until the size of the data within the tile crosses a predetermined threshold. 
This threshold can be, most commonly, the number of rows or the size of the data on disk. 
As we add the data, at the point that the threshold is reached, the data gets split into four higher-order HEALPix tiles using the spatial information contained in the data. 
This process continues until all of the data is stored at the appropriate level and no data leaf has more data than the predetermined threshold. We show an example of the result of this procedure in Figure \ref{fig:order}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{order-pix.png}
\caption{Adaptive tiling for the object catalog of Zwicky Transient Facility, Data Release 14 \citep{ztf:Bellm2019, ztf:Masci2019} To achieve a similar number of rows across the entire sky, we partition the galactic region more finely. This results in tiles of higher HEALPix order in the galactic plane, particularly near the galactic bulge. }
\label{fig:order}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Structure of Data Files} \label{sec:parquet}
The astronomical data is stored in Parquet format\footnote{\href{https://parquet.apache.org}{https://parquet.apache.org}}.
Parquet is a binary, columnar storage file format optimized for efficient data compression and retrieval.
It is ideal for storing large amounts of astronomical tabular data because it enables fast access to specific columns without reading the entire dataset, significantly reducing I/O and improving performance.
Due to its widespread integration with popular processing frameworks such as Dask, Apache Spark, Hadoop, and cloud-native query engines, Parquet has become the de facto standard for analytical workloads in big data ecosystems.
It is also widely adopted in cloud environments, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, and has libraries implemented for various programming languages, making it easy to work with Parquet files in different processing environments. \par

The HATS format RECOMMENDS that the first column of the dataset is the \texttt{\_healpix\_29} index column.  
\texttt{\_healpix\_29} stores the crucial spatial information about the position in the sky for each row, and it is not unique.
This is calculated as the HEALPix order 29 value of the row's right ascension and declination (HEALPix order 29 correspond to the mean separation between HEALPix pixels of 0.000393 arcsec). 
If two objects occur at the same location (or the data is individual observations of the same sky object), then multiple rows may have the same value for the \texttt{\_healpix\_29} column.
The existence of this value speeds up downstream spatial calculations, and is beneficial for spatially-intensive applications.

Additional optional performance considerations for Parquet files is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:parquetPerformance}.

\subsection{Supplemental Tables} \label{sec:supplemental}

To improve scalability and efficient query optimization, HATS readers can benefit from alternative arrangements of the data. 
We refer to these as supplemental tables or supplemental catalogs, and these offer a limited or re-projected view of the primary dataset.

\subsubsection{Margin Cache} \label{sec:margin}

An example of a supplementary table is the Margin Cache. One of the primary motivations for HATS is the rapid cross-matching of different surveys or different data sources within the same survey. 
The power of cross-matching in HATS is that each computation unit gets small spatially-connected parts from each dataset and works on them one part at a time,
with the amount of data being roughly equal in each part, for best efficiency.\par 

However, this introduces a limitation: at the boundaries of a divided section, some data points that should be cross-matched will be missed because they are present just across the border in neighboring partitions instead.
This has a number of causes (observational error, non-point source positions, proper motion, etc), but it should be handled by applications to ensure the appropriate counterpart is found during cross-matching.\par

One option would be to load all neighboring partitions when performing a cross-match. 
However, this would require loading much unnecessary data, as only a small sliver around the edge of a partition is a candidate for counterparts in neighboring partitions. 
Figure~\ref{fig:margin} shows some example data points that are near to a HEALPix tile boundary, and should be included in a cross-match calculation.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{margin-pix.png}
\caption{Example of margin contents. Green points are present in the primary catalog partition, the blue line is the HEALPix pixel boundary, and yellow points are points in the neighboring tile that are within 10 arcseconds of the boundary.}
\label{fig:margin}
\end{figure}

We address this through the creation of a margin cache.
This is an additional catalog that contains points in a limited angular threshold around the primary catalog partition.
The margin catalog MUST contain all points within the indicated angular threshold from the tile boundary, but MAY contain additional points, either for simplicity of spatial calculations, or to provide additional points of interest.\par

The margin data can be loaded alongside the primary catalog partition data during a cross-match operation to account for any positional issues that may arise around the boundaries of the partition's HEALPix pixel.
The margin catalog can be overloaded to also provide a cache of related objects that are not within the primary data partition for other scientific use cases.

\subsubsection{Index Table} \label{sec:index}

HATS catalogs are partitioned spatially, on right ascension and declination. 
This makes finding objects in a particular area of the sky very straightforward. 
However, one may occasionally only know the object by the survey-assigned identifier, and to find the row, would have to perform a full scan of all partitions. \par

HATS supports creating additional secondary index tables. 
To create index tables, we perform a full scan over all of the data, sort by the desired column, and write out a simple mapping from the unique identifier to where it can be found in the sky.
Sorting over such a large dataset can be expensive, and it's preferable to perform this operation once and store the results. \par

This mirrors the relational database notion of a lookup table, where you can lookup the spatial parameters of a non-spatial property.
The user can query the index catalog for the HEALPix tile where the value can be found, and then only need to load the primary catalog partition for the corresponding HEALPix tile. 
This greatly speeds up and facilitates the query, as we now only have to load a single tile instead of going through the whole catalog.
These are general secondary indexes, and can be built on any column, not just the survey-assigned identifier.

\subsubsection{Catalog Collection} \label{sec:collection}

Margins and indexes are associated with a single astronomical dataset, and to make this connection clearer and enable friendlier application behavior, tables MAY be grouped together under a single directory called a catalog collection.
These include the primary data \texttt{catalog} and other \texttt{catalogs} that are optional and are intended either to improve access to the main \texttt{catalog} or to enrich it with additional information. 

In Listing~\ref{fig:exampleCollectionStructure}, we present an overview of this folder structure, including a few common examples of such optional catalogs.
The catalog collection directory MUST contain a \texttt{collection.properties} file, whose content is outlined in Section~\ref{sec:collectionProperties}.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example collection directory contents, label=fig:exampleCollectionStructure]
gaia_dr3/
|-- collection.properties
|-- catalog/
|   |-- properties
|   +-- . . .
|-- [OPTIONAL] margin_5arcs/
|   |-- properties
|   +-- . . .
|-- [OPTIONAL] margin_10arcs/
|   |-- properties
|   +-- . . .
+-- [OPTIONAL] index_designation/
    |-- properties
    +-- . . .
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Association Table} \label{sec:association}

Noting again that cross-matching and multi-survey analysis is a primary motivator for the HATS spatial format, we introduce the HATS association table. 

This table provides a spatially-sharded set of links between rows in two different object catalogs. 
This mirrors the relational database notion of a link table, and will likely be composed of the primary survey identifiers from either side of the association.
We make no prescription as to whether the relationships are one-to-one or one-to-many. \par

There is a single "primary" catalog that reflects the left side, and the other catalog is the "join" catalog (as the data can be joined into the primary catalog).
The resulting association data will use the coordinates of the primary catalog, and MAY be partitioned with the same pixels as the primary catalog.
If there are many more or many fewer association links than there are objects in the primary table, it may be preferable to either combine or split the leaf Parquet files further.

% \subsubsection{Map Catalog} \label{sec:mapCatalog}
% \textcolor{red}{TODO: we should mention this, as it's very useful for science. }

\subsection{Metadata and Auxiliary Files} \label{sec:meta}
HATS implementations utilize auxiliary files and metadata files to store relevant information about the  structure, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{[REQUIRED] properties}, at  \texttt{catalog} level    
    \item \textbf{[RECOMMENDED] partition\_info.csv}, at  \texttt{catalog} level
    \item \textbf{[RECOMMENDED] partition\_join\_info.csv}, at  \texttt{catalog} level
    \item \textbf{[OPTIONAL] point\_map.fits}, at  \texttt{catalog} level
    \item \textbf{[OPTIONAL] data\_thumbnail.parquet}, at  \texttt{catalog} level
    \item \textbf{[RECOMMENDED] \_metadata}, at  \texttt{catalog/dataset} level
    \item \textbf{[RECOMMENDED] \_common\_metadata}, at  \texttt{catalog/dataset} level
    \item \textbf{[REQUIRED] collection.properties}, at  \texttt{catalog} collection level
\end{itemize}
    
Note that collection.properties is only required if creating a \texttt{catalog} collection for your dataset. \par 
We will now go over these files and explain their function, format and their contents. 
    
\subsubsection{properties} 

A text file named \texttt{properties} is REQUIRED in the root level of the catalog directory.
It marks the directory as containing a HATS catalog, and so MUST be located in the root directory of the catalog.
It MUST be encoded in UTF-8, with one line per property, following the syntax \texttt{keyword = value}.
The ordering of the keywords is not important. The keywords MAY include many of those listed in Table~\ref{tab:properties}.

The text file may contain comment lines, beginning with the \texttt{'\#'} character.

An example \texttt{properties} file is shown in Listing~\ref{fig:examplePropertiesFile}.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example \texttt{properties} file contents, label=fig:examplePropertiesFile]

\end{minipage}

We enforce additional requirements for the presence of particular fields for different types of HATS tables. 
A matrix of these requirements is shown in Table~\ref{tab:propertyRequirements}.

\subsubsection{partition\_info.csv} 

A text file named \texttt{partition\_info.csv} is OPTIONAL and RECOMMENDED in the root level of the catalog directory.
If present, it MUST be a CSV (comma-separated-values) file, with the columns \texttt{"Norder"} and \texttt{"Npix"}, as shown in example contents in Listing~\ref{fig:examplePartitionInfoCsv}.
Additional columns might be present in the file, but are not required, and may not be interpreted by all HATS readers.
The values of pairs of \texttt{"Norder"} and \texttt{"Npix"} reflect the HEALPix tiles of the catalog's partitions. 
HATS readers can quickly read this file to understand the full scope of the catalog, and potential spatial overlap with other catalogs.

\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{partition\_join\_info.csv} 

A text file named \texttt{partition\_join\_info.csv} is OPTIONAL and RECOMMENDED in the root level of the catalog directory for an association catalog.
If present, it MUST be a CSV (comma-separated-values) file, with the columns \texttt{"Norder"}, \texttt{"Npix"}, \texttt{"join\_Norder"}, and \texttt{"join\_Npix"}, as shown in example contents in Listing~\ref{fig:examplePartitionJoinInfoCsv}.
Additional columns might be present in the file, but are not required, and may not be interpreted by all HATS readers.
The values of pairs of \texttt{"Norder"} and \texttt{"Npix"} reflect the HEALPix tiles of the primary catalog's partitions. 
The corresponding values of pairs of \texttt{"join\_Norder"} and \texttt{"join\_Npix"} reflect the HEALPix tiles of the join catalog's partitions that have matches inside the primary catalog's partition.
HATS readers can quickly read this file to understand the full spatial overlap with other catalogs, and plan which leaf partitions of the primary and join catalogs will be loaded. \par

This file is not used for table types that are NOT association tables.

\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{point\_map.fits} 

A FITS file containing the HEALPix skymap of the catalog.
This is a two-dimensional histogram of points in each HEALPix tile at some reasonably high order.
This will be at the highest order calculated during the catalog ingestion process (likely 9 or 10). 
This data is useful when inspecting catalogs and understanding the distribution of data. 

This file is OPTIONAL and RECOMMENDED for object catalogs.

\subsubsection{data\_thumbnail.parquet} 
This is a small dataset aimed to help users to understand and use the data. 
It MUST have the same overall data schema as the data partitions themselves.
It MUST not be larger than the threshold used to split data partitions.
The data it contains should represent the diversity of the catalog well. \par

This file gives the user a quick overview of the whole dataset.
Given how it is sampled, it will cover the entire width of the dataset, and give a reasonably accurate overview of the properties of the dataset. 
It is thus both more convenient than, and superior to, directing a user to a subset of any single Parquet data partition for the same purposes.

This file is OPTIONAL and RECOMMENDED for object catalogs.

\subsubsection{\_metadata and \_common\_metadata} 

Many Parquet reading frameworks support and recommend additional dataset-level metadata files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\_common\_metadata} which contains the full schema of the dataset. 
    This file will know all of the columns and their types, as well as any file-level key-value metadata associated with the full Parquet dataset.
    \item \texttt{\_metadata} contains per-partition information, chiefly the storage information and column metadata and statistics.
\end{itemize}

Both files are OPTIONAL and RECOMMENDED for all catalogs.

To understand the importance of these files, it is helpful to understand the structure of partitioned Parquet files. 
Figure~\ref{fig:partitionedParquet} shows a schematic of two partitioned Parquet files. 

The data values are shown in gray, and typically will take up most of the space of the Parquet file. 
Data is stored and compressed on disk per "row group".
File 1 in Figure~\ref{fig:partitionedParquet} contains less data, and it all fits into a single row group.
File 2 in Figure~\ref{fig:partitionedParquet} contains more data, and is split on disk into two row groups. 
All of the metadata is stored inside the file footer. There is some file-level metadata that may describe the full dataset, as well as column-level key-value metadata.
Parquet files MAY also have aggregate statistics about values in each column (minimum value, maximum value, count of valid values).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{leaf_files.png}
\caption{Example file layout of two Parquet files of a dataset}
\label{fig:partitionedParquet}
\end{figure}

For very large datasets, it is helpful to have a single file that holds the common data schema information in all of the partitioned Parquet files (assuming that they have homogeneous structure).
This \texttt{\_common\_metadata} file can be much smaller (and so faster to read) than a leaf Parquet file.
The column statistics, however, will be different for every file, and some files may contain multiple statistics segments if the data inside a single file is very large and has been divided into multiple row groups.
These statistics can be concatenated into a single \texttt{\_metadata} file, and can provide valuable insight into the distribution of the data. 
A clever Parquet reader can use this information to filter queries to only those partitions where certain values are possible.
See Figure~\ref{fig:parquetMetadata} for the layout of these two Parquet metadata files.

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{metadata_files.png}
\caption{Example file layout of two supplemental Parquet files of a dataset}
\label{fig:parquetMetadata}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{collection.properties}\label{sec:collectionProperties}
A text file named \texttt{collection.properties} is REQUIRED for a catalog collection.
It marks the directory as containing a catalog collection, and so MUST be located in the 
root of the catalog collection.
It MUST be encoded in UTF-8, with one line per property, following the syntax \texttt{keyword = value}.
The ordering of the keywords is not important. 
The keywords MAY include many of those listed in Table~\ref{tab:properties}, with collection-specific fields shown in Table~\ref{tab:propertyRequirements}.

The text file may contain comment lines, beginning with the \texttt{'\#'} character.
An example \texttt{properties} file is shown in Listing~\ref{fig:exampleCollectionPropertiesFile}.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example \texttt{collection.properties} file contents, label=fig:exampleCollectionPropertiesFile]

\section{Performance Considerations}
Here, we will elaborate on several ways in which this format can be efficiently used. These insights come from our work with LSDB\footnote{\url{https://lsdb.io}}, a Python implementation of a package that works natively with HATS catalogs. \par

\subsection{Parquet Storage}\label{sec:parquetPerformance}
Firstly, we emphasize the need to use the Parquet column filtering. 
Loading into memory only the columns that a user needs for scientific analysis, typically just a few out of the tens or hundreds available, significantly reduces the computational requirements for the analysis.  \par 

We can also split Parquet files into so-called row groups, splitting Parquet into chunks with a fixed number of rows. 
Parquet readers can skip over entire row groups if they don't contain relevant data, using the Parquet row group footer's min and max values for hints. 
This is especially effective when row groups are designed to match the access patterns of a specific scientific use case. 
For instance, if rowgroups are made to be small and sorted by the identification number of the survey, the retrieval of the individual rows by survey identification can be made much faster. 
Speed-up happens because we don't have to load the entire Parquet file into memory, but only the smaller rowgroup, to retrieve the needed row with the required identification number.\par 

\subsection{HTTP Services}
The fact that the data can be stored on the hard drive and served to the users simplifies the cost structure for catalog providers. 
However, a user operating on the dataset, even if they are doing aggressive filtering and requesting a minimal number of rows at the end, will still have to transfer a large amount of data to their client, where the filtering is actually conducted. 
These limitations could become prohibitive if done over a network or with limited bandwidth. 
To alleviate that problem, it is possible to implement a server-side query in which the filtering operations are done server-side, and only the final dataset is sent to a user. 
Of course, this requires computational resources on the provider's side, but operates on a single file and will benefit from Parquet storage optimizations from Section~\ref{sec:parquetPerformance}

\subsection{Cross-matching}
Finally, we want to highlight the exceptional performance possible when cross-matching HATS catalogs. 
Due to its spatial sharding, the cross-matching approach implemented in LSDB is competitive with the existing tools for small data, and is more efficient for large catalogs, starting with roughly one million rows. 
The key advantage lies in the fine-grained spatial partitioning: each data chunk is designed to fit comfortably into memory, allowing efficient parallel processing without memory bottlenecks. Users can increase the number of parallel computation units, and‚Äîprovided the number of workers remains below the number of partitions and I/O throughput is sufficient‚Äîachieve near-linear scaling. \par 

For typical cases of large catalogs (more than billion rows), cross-matching on a single core is around 5 to 15\% slower than the pure I/O speed. 
As discussed above, selecting only specific columns and parallelizing the work can drastically improve performance.   

\section{Role within the VO Architecture}

\begin{figure}
\centering

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{role_diagram.pdf}
\caption{Architecture diagram for this document}
\label{fig:archdiag}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:archdiag} shows the role this document plays within the IVOA architecture.

HATS is designed to be compatible with existing VO spatial indexing frameworks, such as HEALPix and MOC (Multi-Order Coverage maps) \citep{ivoa:MOC}. \par
It builds upon the nested HEALPix tessellation scheme, which provides a hierarchical and uniform way to partition the celestial sphere. This structure is central to HATS: both the storage layout and the spatial indexing are defined in terms of HEALPix pixels.
The full footprint of the catalog can alternatively be represented by a MOC, as it is a list of HEALPix pixels, at many different HEALPix orders. \par 

The HATS format can be made to be compatible with the TAP query \citep{IVOA:TAP} by implementing a translation layer between the TAP query language. 
We have explored some initial implementation of such functionality, but the implementation details will always depend on the language used to handle the Parquet files. \par

\subsection{VOParquet}

We are closely following the development of the VOParquet \citep{IVOAPARQUET} format and aim to implement it as a part of HATS catalogs.

The VOParquet format specifies that the VO metadata should be present in the file-level key-value metadata of the parquet file.
We RECOMMEND that the VOParquet metadata be included in all parquet files, be they ancilliary metadata files (\texttt{\_common\_metadata}, \texttt{\_metadata}, \texttt{data\_thumbnail.parquet}) or data partitions.
If VOParquet metadata exists in one data partition file, it MUST be present in all data partitions.

HATS catalogs MAY contain additional parquet files beyond the data partitions, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:meta}. 
The mix of optional files and optional metadata within the files will introduce points of confusion. 
Here we discuss the motivation behind our recommendations, and their consequences.\par

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\texttt{\_common\_metadata}] contains the merged schema for all data partition parquet files.
  If a \texttt{\_common\_metadata} file exists, it WILL have a superset of all key-value metadata present in the data partitions. 
  It follows that it MUST have the VO metadata present to be considered VOParquet.
  \item[\texttt{\_metadata}] contains some schema information, but is not required to contain all schema information.
  It MAY contain the VOParquet metadata, but if it does NOT contain the metadata, the catalog may still be considered valid VOParquet if the metadata is present elsewhere.
  \item[\texttt{data\_thumbnail.parquet}] MUST have the same overall data schema as the data partitions themselves.
  It follows that it MUST have the VO metadata present to be considered VOParquet.
\end{itemize}

If the \texttt{\_common\_metadata} and \texttt{data\_thumbnail.parquet} files are not present, the VO metadata must be present in ALL data partitions to be considered VOParquet.
